            <p>
              When we started, the core idea was that we will make games that we
              want to play. Games that had progressive gameplay on the one hand
              and cinematic production values.
            </p>

          <div className="parahraph2">
            <h4>Play it</h4>
            <p>
              Our games up to now have been different from any genre that
              existed at the time; we made new genres by ourselves. We didn't
              rely on testimonials in a business textbook to do what we've done.
